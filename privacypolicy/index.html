        <p>v1.0.0—last updated 2018-05-26</p>

        <h2 id="toc_1">Overview</h2>

        <p>In order for us to operate our business and provide our services to You, it is sometimes necessary for us to collect or process information about You. In general terms, this information will take one or more of the following forms:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Information that you provide to us directly, such as in the situation where you complete an online form or send us a message via our website;</li>
            <li>Information that is automatically sent to us by Your computer’s internet browser when you visit our website, such as your computer’s technical address (or “IP address”) or information about which particular internet browser you are using and so on;</li>
            <li>Information about how you use our website or our services, such as which pages you visit, how frequently you visit the site and so forth.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This privacy policy sets out the detail of what information we collect, as well as how that data is used and protected.</p>

        <h2 id="toc_2">Our Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>

        <p>We are fully committed to maintaining the privacy of any information (“personal data”) that you provide to us. Furthermore, we commit to ensuring that such data is held securely, used appropriately and only retained for as long as is necessary.</p>

        <p>Our systems and services are designed with privacy in mind, and we operate on a “data minimisation” principle wherever possible – that is to say that we will only ever ask you for the minimum amount of information required to provide our services efficiently; we have no desire to retain (and therefore maintain) any more information than is necessary.</p>

        <p>We aspire to comply to the fullest extent possible with applicable data protection regulations, in particular the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and ePrivacy Directive, where applicable.</p>

        <h2 id="toc_3">Who We Are</h2>

        <p>In terms of your use of this website, We, BeautyCa by Ilona Demidenko, act in the capacity of Data Controller, and should you have any questions or concerns about the data we hold about you, we can be contacted using the information below:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Controller</strong>: BeautyCa by Ilona Demidenko</li>
            <li><p><strong>Correspondence address</strong>:</p>

                <p>Ilona Demidenko<br>
                    Friedrichstr. 123<br>
                    Berlin 10117<br>
                    Germany</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Email correspondence</strong>: <a href="mailto:ilona@beuatyca.net">ilona@beuatyca.net</a></p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="toc_4">Definition of Personal Data</h2>

        <p>When we refer to “personal data” we mean any information that allows us to identify you personally. Obvious examples include your name, email address, postal address etc.</p>

        <p>We will always seek to gain your explicit consent to providing this information before we collect it from you, although this may not be the only legal basis on which we collect the data.</p>

        <p>Other types of information, such as your computer’s “IP” address or broad geographical location do not, generally, allow us to identify you directly.</p>

        <p>However, because in their current form, European data privacy regulations are somewhat vague in this regard, we will cover the use of such data here also.</p>

        <h2 id="toc_5">Who We Share Data With</h2>

        <p>We operate on a strict “need to know” basis for all data that we work with, and that is particularly true for any personal data. The only people/organisations that are granted access to personal data are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Employees of BeautyCa by Ilona Demidenko who provide content-creation, design, marketing, sales, software development, and/or support services;</li>
            <li><p>Our web hosting technology suppliers (currently GitHub Pages) who provide the static website server that we operate on. Only the technical address of your computer (“IP address”) is being transfered by your browser to these website servers.</p>

                <p>For cross-border data transfers from the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA), GitHub adheres to the Privacy Shield Framework.</p></li>
            <li><p>Our email marketing automation platform MailChimp who provide data processing services. MailChimp is an US based company which means that your data is transferred to servers outside the European Union.</p>

                <p>MailChimp has certified to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, so your personal data is transferred lawfully outside of the EU to MailChimp in the U.S.</p>

                <p>Read MailChimp’s <a href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/terms/">Terms</a>.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>We are in the process of signing Data Processing Agreements with all the 3rd party providers above.</p>

        <h2 id="toc_6">How Your Data is Protected</h2>

        <p>We take the security of all personal data very seriously, and that data is protected in a number of ways:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access control</strong>: access to personal data is strictly limited in line with our policy detailed in the “who we share data with section” on this page. Access is controlled by individual user accounts, where a strong password policy is enforced.</li>
            <li><p><strong>Data encryption</strong>: This website is secured with SSL encryption, which means that all traffic to and from our servers is encrypted. This applies to our own administrative access to the website as well as that of users of our services.</p>

                <p>Additionally, we ensure that our own dedicated secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) is used when we access the site from anywhere on a public wifi network.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Selection of third party service providers</strong>: we use a very limited number of third party service providers, but some are essential for the provision of physical hosting environments, cloud services, and email services. One of the core factors in the selection of such providers is their ability to provide secure systems and processes.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="toc_7">Access to Your Personal Data</h2>

        <p>In the situation where you have directly provided personal information to us (such as by completing an online form or contacting us for further information), you have a number of rights regarding the personal data that we hold:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>You have the right to obtain from us confirmation about whether any such data is being held;</li>
            <li>You have the right to require that we provide you with whatever data we are holding/processing about you, including the right for that data to be transferred to another data controller;</li>
            <li>Even if you have consented to Us processing your personal data, you have the right to withdraw that permission at any time;</li>
            <li>You have the right to require us to rectify any incomplete or incorrect information held about you;</li>
            <li>You have the right to require us to erase the data held about you (the “right to be forgotten”);</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In the situation where we collect personal data automatically (such as from your internet browser or via internet Cookies or other similar technologies):</p>

        <ul>
            <li>You have the right to object to the legal basis upon which we are collecting this data, and We have an obligation to consider and respond to that objection;</li>
            <li>You have the right to request the prevention of further processing of your data while your objection is considered;</li>
            <li>You have the right to make a complaint to the relevant data protection authority (In Berlin/Germany: Berliner Beauftragte für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit (BlnBDI)).</li>
            <li>In most circumstances, you can exercise these rights without paying a fee to us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id="toc_8">Types of Data Collected</h1>

        <h2 id="toc_9">Sign-up Forms</h2>

        <p>For some website functionality you will need to become an “Early Adopter” by signing up with your E-Mail. That is required because the requested access to Alpha/Beta version of the upcoming product will be delivered to you by the provided E-Mail. Additionally, the E-Mail you have provided will become your account identifier.</p>

        <p>If, at the same sign-up form, you have requested to not only receive the access to Alpha/Beta version of the upcoming product, but you have also requested to receive updates about product development over E-Mail, we are going to need to process your E-Mail to send you these updates, as well.</p>

        <p>Data collected will generally involve your name and email address (which doubles as username) as a minimum, but may include your postal address if it is required for online purchases.</p>

        <p>If you do not sign up to receive such content, then no such data will be collected in this regard.</p>

        <h3 id="toc_10">Legal Basis</h3>

        <p><strong>You Have Given us Consent (GDPR Art 6(1)(a))</strong>: On every such sign-up form, we will ask You to provide Your explicit freely-given consent to permit us to process Your personal data in order to fullfil your request.</p>

        <p><strong>Processing is Neccessary For The Performance of a Contract (GDPR Art 6(1)(b))</strong>: In order for Us to complete Your request that You express by submitting a specific sign-up form, we need to process Your personal data.</p>

        <h4 id="toc_11">Types of Processing</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>We will <strong>transfer</strong> the information you provide us to our Data Processor MailChimp for <strong>processing</strong> and <strong>storage</strong>;</li>
            <li>We will <strong>process</strong> this data using MailChimp services in order to fullfil Your requests that You have expressed by submitting the sign-up form;</li>
            <li>We will NOT transfer or store this data anywhere else;</li>
            <li>We will NOT use this data for any further purpose without your express of further consent;</li>
            <li>We will NEVER sell your information to any 3rd party.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="toc_12">Data Minimisation</h4>

        <p>We will only ask you for the minimum amount of information required to appropriately fulfil your request. We will only use mandatory/required fields where it is necessary to do so.</p>

        <h4 id="toc_13">Retention</h4>

        <p>We will retain this data for as long as you stay an active “Early Adopter” of the product, or an active “User” of the future product(s), plus a maximum of 12 months.</p>

        <p>If You would like to stop being an “Early Adopter” of the product you can use the “Unsubscribe” link, that You can find at the bottom of every E-Mail that We are sending to You.</p>

        <p>If you would like to stop being a “User” of the future product, you can send us an E-Mail with your request to delete your account and any of your personal data.</p>

        <h2 id="toc_14">Technical Data (Such as “IP” Address)</h2>

        <p>When you visit our website, our systems will log a record of your visit in our server logs, and typically this record will include the technical “IP” address that is associated with your device and the browser type and version that you are using.</p>

        <p>Such server logs are extremely common practice, and are used to monitor technical resources, monitor high-level server activity, and importantly to detect and prevent malicious or fraudulent activity on our systems.</p>

        <p>This data can also be used, if required, to diagnose reports of technical issues. The storage of IP addresses, allow us to identify patterns of behaviour (such as repeated malicious attempts to access a system).</p>

        <p>IP addresses, in and of themselves, do not allow us in any way to identify you as an individual, especially given that it is very common for IP addresses to be dynamically allocated by your service provider, and will therefore often routinely change.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, we do not and will not use the content of server access logs to attempt to determine an identifiable individual. We therefore do not consider that data held within server logs falls within the scope of “personal data”, and accordingly we do not seek your consent to collect it.</p>

        <h3 id="toc_15">Legal Basis</h3>

        <p>In the event that such anonymous data is considered to fall within the scope of the applicable data protection regulations, the legal basis for processing such data is:</p>

        <p><strong>Our Legitimate interest (GDPR Art 6(1)(f))</strong>: The integrity, security and performance of our systems and infrastructure is a vital part of the services that we offer. We consider that it is in our legitimate interest to maintain and protect our systems to this end.</p>

        <h4 id="toc_16">Types of Processing</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>We will <strong>store</strong> the information you provide to us in our website server logs</li>
            <li>For the purpose of maintaining the integrity of our systems, we may also store this data in infrastructure backups</li>
            <li>We will NOT use this data to attempt to identify an individual person</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="toc_17">Cookies &amp; “Similar Technologies”</h2>

        <p>We are not collecting any cookies or use any similar technologies.</p>

        <h2 id="toc_18">Website Analytics</h2>

        <p>We are not using any website analytics technology.</p>

        <h2 id="toc_19">What Information We Do Not Collect</h2>

        <p>We do not collect <strong>sensitive personal information</strong>, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information.</p>

        <p>If you&#39;re a <strong>child under the age of 13</strong>, you may not use this website or have an account for any of our products. We do not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to close your account and delete any of your data. </p>

        <p>Other countries may have different minimum age limits, and if you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may not use our website or our products without obtaining your parents’ or legal guardians’ consent.</p>
